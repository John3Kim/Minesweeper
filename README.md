# Minesweeper
 Implementing the minesweeper game.  
 
## Game Information: 
 
Objective: Given a board of n by m dimensions, and a set number of mines, the objective of the game is to clear the field without hitting any hidden mines.  

## Some tidbits: 
- Adding flags to the field will help you mark tiles that are suspected to contain a mine. 
- Numbers indicate the number of mines in surrounding the tiles.  For example, given the following board: \ 

  [0,1,2]\
0: 3 X X\
1: X X X\
2: X X X\

- You can see above that there are three mines surrounding the tile at (0,0).
